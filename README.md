*Simple Quantum Circuit*

The Quantaum __"[Measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics)"__ circuits allows us to measure and store data from our Quantum Processor(QP). This data is loaded onto Classical Registers.

There are 7 main concepts here: 

1. Measurements
2. Evolution of Closed Sytems
3. Classical and Quantum Many-Body
4. Gate Model
5. Adiabatic Model
6. Variational Circuits
7. Q_Ensemble
